## [DCQCN+: Taming Large-scale Incast Congestion in RDMA over Ethernet Networks](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/tianchen/lunwen/2018/icnp18-DCQCNplus.pdf)

### 解决问题

[DCQCN](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2015/pdf/papers/p523.pdf)是目前RDMA over Ethernet Networks的拥塞控制算法，但是大规模的incast导致其性能下降。

### 核心思想 

动态参数控制：发送端需要知悉incast的规模, using a long period and a small increase step for large-scale incast, and a short period and a large increase step for small-scale incast.

### DCQCN: Fixed rate recovery period(K) and fixed increase steps(R_AI)

#### 1. Flow rate reduction: 

- The receiver generates and sends a CNP to the sender only if (1) the received packet is marked on ECN bits and (2) the flow has not been notified for a fixed period. This period, called **interval between CNPs N**, is a static parameter that needed to be configured ahead of time. DCQCN 设置为固定的50us.

- Senders cut the current rate RC and the target rate RT as follows:

   α denotes the reduction factor, g is a pre-configured constant, and Rmin means the minimum rate of a flow. Rate cut is trivial. If CNPs are received for 2 or more periods, α will increase and rate cut ratio will be larger at the next time.

#### 2. Flow rate recovery:

- Receivers maintain a time counter and a byte counter and corresponding state bits for each flow. There is also a state counter to sign the state of increase. The time state and byte state are set to 0 after rate cut. When a flow has not received CNPs for time **K = 55us**, its time state increases. When a flow has already sent B bytes without receiving a CNP, its byte state increases. When one of the two states is not 0, the flow starts recovery in a bisecting way for F = 5 rounds called Fast Recovery (FR):

   <img width="150" height="150" src="/img/post-dcqcn+-2.png"/>

- The start of a new round is the increase of the states. After that, *Additive Increase (AI)* and *Hyper Increase (HI)* can be triggered. In *Additive Increase*, rate increases by fixed step R_AI:

   <img width="150" height="150" src="/img/post-dcqcn+-3.png"/>

- *Hyper Increase* is triggered when both the states exceed F. In *Hyper Increase*, the rate shows an exponential growth with parameter RHAI, i = min {time_state, byte_state} − F: 

   <img width="150" height="150" src="/img/post-dcqcn+-4.png"/>

- At each recovery, α will also decrease: 

   <img width="150" height="150" src="/img/post-dcqcn+-5.png"/>

#### 3. Line-rate strategy: 

   In DCQCN, flows start at line rate to get full utilization of links. But line-rate is so aggressive that as the number of congested flow grows, the trivial-way rate cut needs more periods to take effect.

#### 4. DCQCN 设计与实际 Mellanox CX4网卡参数的不同:

#### 5. 简单地调大K、调小R_AI对小Incast不友好

### Design

- **The recovery timer should always be larger than the CNP period to receive a CNP**. All congested flows with the same receiver share the CNPs equally by time multiplexing. Thus, **CNP period can reflect the number of congested flows on the receiver**. We utilize an available field in CNPs to carry the CNP period without using additional signal packets.

- **The total throughput increase should not increase as the number of congested flows grows**. Thus, increase step R_AI should be proportional to flow rate.
  

   


### Implementation and evaluation


- Large-scale Incast.

- Small-scale Incast.
